By JeSTeR


This is a complete automated server security/hardening tool
all you have to do is configure the options 
IE.
####### Your Email And Other Needed Info
mymail="root@localhost" # Will End Up In /var/mail/root
#######  Adduser BadName like $ adduser JeSTeR
#######  Things Simple Like Adding UPPER/lower case names
#######  Can Confuse Hackers And Make Things Alot Harder
badname="JeSTeR"
#######  Admin User (Like Root) Mine Is (user2="JeSTeR")
#######  Select permroot="no" And use this server as sudo
user2="Systemback" # This User Will Have Full 100% Access
#######  SSH Key Types (SHA256/md5)
hashkey="SHA256" # Change This To Prefered
#######  SSH Config ( * = ALL)
sship="123.456.789.012" # The IP Your Server Will Listen For SSH 
sshd="52529"  # The Port You Want SSH To Use
permroot="no" # Permit root logins (yes/no)
#######  IRC Ports
irc1="6665"
irc2="6667"
irc3="6669"
irc4="7000"
irc5="7010"
irc6="7012"
#######  IRC SSL
irc7="6697"
#######  BlackList Subnets Or Single IPs
#######  Can Be In Synax Like (1.2.3.4/2.3.4.5 OR 1.2.3.4)
subnet="103.10.197.50/103.10.197.59"
subnet1="212.21.66.6/212.21.66.60"
subnet2="66.180.193.219"
